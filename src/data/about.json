    "I graduated from Montgomery Bell Academy in Nashville, TN in 2017 and struggled to find something that truly interested me after completing high school. This changed a couple years later when I was referred to Nashville Software School by a friend and decided to take the risk. I fell in love with software development, specifically web, and haven't regretted it since.",
    "I was lucky enough to land a job before graduation, but as we all know tech is a field filled with layoffs, and I was unfortunately hit by them as well. However, I didn't want to sit and do nothing while endlessly applying for a new job, so I decided to develop this portfolio as a fun side project that can also help me in my job search."
